# 🧠 Cortexia — Give Any AI a Human-Like Brain

Ever noticed how your AI forgets everything between sessions?

You explain your coding style. Your project architecture. Your preferences. Then the session ends. Next time? You explain it all over again. That's thousands of wasted tokens. Wasted time. Wasted money.

**Cortexia fixes this.**

Built on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) — the same model used in computational neuroscience — Cortexia gives your AI a real brain. Not a database. A brain.

- Memories strengthen with repetition, fade with time (Ebbinghaus curves)
- Neurotransmitter simulation (dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine)
- AI develops its own personality through interaction
- Smart document library — ingest files, brain searches like a library
- Token savings tracker — see exactly how much you save

This is NOT traditional RAG. RAG searches a vector database — cold, mechanical, static. Cortexia remembers like a human. Important things stick. Trivial things fade.

Works with **Claude Code**, and any LLM via **MCP** (Model Context Protocol).

```
npm install -g cortexia
```

## The Math

Without Cortexia: 50 sessions × 500 tokens of repeated context = **25,000 wasted tokens**

With Cortexia: Explain once. Brain remembers. **Save ~24,500 tokens.**

At scale — 100 sessions/day × 30 days = **1,500,000 wasted tokens/month.** Cortexia pays for itself.
